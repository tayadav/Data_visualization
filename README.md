# Data Visualization Group Project

This is the summary of the group project delivered by Study Group 1 for Data Visualisation Module.

## Dataset selection
We decided to select COVID-19 data with focus on vaccination impacts on further infections. 

## Issues to explore
We want to understand how vaccination has slowed down infections and development of pandemic across different countries. Additionally, we want to understand how general mental health of the general public has been impacted by COVID-19 pandemic before and after the breakout.

## Statistical technique
We would probably use statistical techniques such as multivariate regressions to understand the demographic differences of vaccination on the general public.
