# Data Visualization Group Project
This is the summary of the group project delivered by Study Group 1 for the Data Visualisation Module.

## Dataset selection
We decided to focus our efforts on the relationship between COVID-19 and mental health. 
This following dataset would provide happiness data across different countries after the COVID-19 breakout.

This dataset would provide a benchmark for happiness data across different countries before the COVID-19 breakout.

This last dataset would provide data of latest COVID-19 cases across different countries.

## Issues to explore
Firstly, we would like to explore how COVID has generally impacted countries across the world. Then, we want to understand how general mental health of the general public has been impacted by COVID-19 pandemic before and during the breakout by looking at the world happiness report. In addition, we will closely analyze whether mental health could have any influence on the outcome of the COVID-19 infection of individuals, for example, reducing death risk.

## Statistical technique
We would probably use statistical techniques such as correlations, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, multivariate or logistic regressions to understand the demographic differences of wellbeing on the general public before and during the pandemic.
