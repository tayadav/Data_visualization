# Data Visualization Group Project

This is the summary of the group project delivered by Study Group 1 for the Data Visualisation Module.

## Dataset selection
We decided to focus our efforts on the relationship between COVID-19 and mental health. 

## Issues to explore
We want to understand how general mental health of the general public has been impacted by COVID-19 pandemic before and after the breakout. In addition, we will closely analyze whether mental health has any influence on the outcome of the COVID-19 infection of individuals, for example, reducing death risk.

## Statistical technique
We would probably use statistical techniques such as multivariate regressions to understand the demographic differences of vaccination on the general public.
