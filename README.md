# Data Visualization Group Project
This is the summary of the group project delivered by Study Group 1 for the Data Visualisation Module.

## Background
Due to incredibly large distances in the US, many more of the routes are covered by airplane compared to Europe, for example. Naturally travelling across the country can quickly become quite expensive, unless you are one of the "travel hackers". 
Over time, it has become quite popular to find deals that enable air fares that are basically free. 
While it may not be the most conventional way of flying, passengers on flights with more than 3 hours of delay receive large monetary compensation. Consequently, we decided to investigate air travel and see whether we can identify certain routes where large delays are probable and thus, a high likelihood of monetary compensation for travellers. 

## Dataset selection
We decided to focus our efforts on air travel starting in New York City. With 3 large airports spread around the city, the world's financial center is well connected across the US with 16 million passengers solely going through JFK airport. (<https://www.statista.com/statistics/962767/passenger-traffic-new-york-john-f-kennedy-type/>).  
Therefore, we decide to analyse airport activity in JFK, LaGuardia and Newark Airport in New York in 2013 for inland flights across the US. This data was the most recent data available for United States travel, and while it may not be representative of a post-Covid era, it should be sufficient to recognize patterns of when flights are more likely to be delayed.

## Issues to explore
The analysis is conducted from the perspective of a traveller that is looking for any destination across the US for a holiday. However, the traveller has a relatively small budget and would therefore like to be reimbursed for his/her flight fair caused by a severe arrival delay. Consequently, we investigated the choices that can be influenced by the traveller, such as:
- Season
- Daytime
- Airport
- Airline
- Destination

## Statistical technique
We would probably use statistical techniques such as correlations, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, multivariate or logistic regressions to understand and determine the impact of variables on arrival delay.
